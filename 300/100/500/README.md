# 500 - Authoring

Letâ€™s try making a small change and then re-rendering:

1. Change the the line of code that defines ```theta``` as follows:

```theta = 4 * np.pi * r```

2. Re-render the file (using **Quarto: Render HTML** or the ```Ctrl+Shift+K``` shortcut) The document is rendered, and the browser preview is updated.

This is the basic workflow for authoring with Quarto.

You do not need to save the file before rendering (as this happens automatically when you render). It you prefer, you can configure the Quarto extension to render whenever you save a document. See the documentation on [Render on Save](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/vscode.html#render-on-save) for additional details.
