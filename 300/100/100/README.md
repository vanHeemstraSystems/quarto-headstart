# 100 - Overview

In this tutorial we’ll show you how to use Quarto with VS Code. Before getting started, you should install the [Quarto VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto), which includes many tools that enhance working with Quarto, including:

- Integrated render and preview for Quarto documents.
- Syntax highlighting for markdown and embedded languages
- Completion and diagnostics for YAML options
- Completion for embedded languages (e.g. Python, R, Julia, etc.)
- Commands and key-bindings for running cells and selected lines.

You can install the Quarto extension from within the **Extensions** tab in VS Code, from the [Extension Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto), the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/quarto/quarto) or directly from a [VISX extension file](https://open-vsx.org/extension/quarto/quarto).

**Note**: This tutorial focuses on editing plain text Quarto ```.qmd``` files in VS Code. You can alternatively use the VS Code Notebook Editor if you prefer to work with ```.ipynb``` files.

For the purposes of learning we recommend you follow along with the ```.qmd``` examples. At the end of this article there is a link to documentation on using the [Notebook Editor](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/vscode.html#notebook-editor) with Quarto that will apply what you’ve learned to notebooks.
